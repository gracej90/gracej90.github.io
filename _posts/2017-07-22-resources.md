I'm back! It's been a few weeks and they flew by. We're now approaching August and it's definitely getting warmer. Below are a few of my favourite resources that I wanted to share, in no particular order.

* [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com)
* [Udacity's Data Analytics Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?v=a4)
* [Code Academy](https://codeacademy.com)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

Recently, I am brushing up on Python before starting the Data Science course @ General Assembly. Below is an incredible post with an exhaustive list of resources that I am excited to peruse one by one.
* [Python Tips](https://pythontips.com/2016/02/27/learning-python-for-data-science/#more-712)

### How I continue to learn in & outside work

When you are first starting to learn, it'll feel overwhelming. There are so many resouces online, and it appears everyone knows what they're talking about. You are likely to feel lost, confused, frustrated, and other feelings you'd rather avoid. I'm thankful to have the opportunity to apply what I learn at work, which is learning in and of itself, but below are some ways I am disciplining myself to continue learning outside.

My work hours usually range from 9 to 7 - 7:30p. Instead of going home where there are many distractions, I found it helpful recently to bike straight to Mendocino Farms, a nice restaurant with wifi where I can have healthy dinner and study at my leisure. I pull up [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com) and commit myself to spend at least 30 minutes going through a lesson. DataCamp is great in that it has bite-sized lessons and has a good balance between theory and interactive coding. There are numerous lessons on R and Python, and there always seems to be a new lesson coming so you'll not run of things to learn on this awesome platform.

I enjoy learning with others too in an in-class environment, and have missed that aspect of learning. [General Assembly](https://generalassembly.com) provides a great option for that, and it's also really nice they have locations in both Santa Monica and DTLA. Starting mid-August, I'll be taking the Data Science class with 2 of my coworkers. It will be Monday / Wednesday from 7 to 10p, and I will have to invest additional hours on the weekend to study but I think it'll be an invaluable experience. Below is a tech guide they shared as part of the pre-work.

I used to think "formal" learning stops after college, if you don't go back to grad school. But there are incredible companies out there these days that enable online learning like never before. It's amazing how much you can learn on your own, with minimal financial investment. Of course there are great benefits to having a degree in the field you're passionate about, and I am thinking of getting a Master's in Data Science too. But in the meantime, you can always continue to learn using the incredible resources available online.

Next, I'll share some R learnings!
