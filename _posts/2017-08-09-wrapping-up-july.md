Came down with a cold or flu and took the day off today. Haven't been sick in awhile so it kind of took me by surprise - the recent hyper active few days probably took a toll on my body. It also surprised me to find today is Aug. 9th already! Each day passes by with series of events that seem to all mash together into a big jumble.

Recently I've been reflecting less and doing more, so I thought it was a good time to write a thought driven post.

Apart from more easily apparent differences, we all live more or less similarly - wake up, make breakfast, work, and dinner. Some of us have cool hobbies, ambitious goals, fancy travel plans, but we all know that's not the norm. For some reason, the bubble that I've placed myself in has got me thinking these things are the norm. Instead of embracing the regularity of life, I found myself in constant pursuit of excitement.

I used to think it must be a personality thing - being bored easily or generally curious about new things. But there is an element of being content with the regularity of life, that I struggled to embrace. Earlier this year, when I returned to LA I was more or less forced to be in this state of regularity for good 2 months. I did the same thing each day and clung to the routine, a stark contrast to the whirlwind of travels I did just prior. I faced the dullness of Santa Clarita retirement life head on, with little time to prep.

Surprisingly, the more I did what I did, the more I felt calm and energized - each day there was no reason to fret about what I should / would / could be doing and I simply enjoyed each moment as it carried me forward. My only focus was staying close to God and building my relationship with Him - everything else became less significant and slowly faded away.

Now that I'm back in the "real world", this regularity is something I've come to really appreciate. Favourite parts of my day these days are biking to and from work, and coming home to make dinner with Coffee Table Jazz playlist quietly humming in the background. Not to say I don't enjoy excitement - recently I started learning to surf and it's been a blast. But now after the excitement subsides, I can return to my happy place where gentle ebbs of life await.
