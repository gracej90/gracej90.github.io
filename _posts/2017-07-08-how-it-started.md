Currently sitting at my favourite coffeeshop on Montana - primo passo coffee co. I am not a coffee lover, as many of my close family and friends are, but I do appreciate a nice place to sit in the corner and quietly work while sipping on my go-to chai tea. This spot has no wifi, but it's perfect for me to work on these posts on my favourite text editor, [Atom](atom.io).

I hope to do this on a regular basis, at least 1x a week on saturday mornings - maybe it can be some sort of a journal.

Well, today I thought I'd share how I started on my journey to be a data analyst. In college, I majored in international studies and got a certificate in markets & management. I enjoyed math and science, but gravitated towards courses that exposed me to culture, history, and philosophy. I spent hours learning Japanese, and pouring over Tolstoy classics to better understand the world outside of what I was used to, which was a small suburb in LA with nearly 30% of population being Korean.

During and after college, I worked in consulting. It was the best fit for someone who was unsure of what she wanted to do, but enjoyed project based work where things continue change. I also had the amazing opportunity to work in Seoul and Tokyo, which was an invaluable experience for a fresh grad. After a little over a year, I came back to the U.S. and joined a startup in SF. It was the thing to do at the time, but I wasn't clear on what I actually wanted to do. It was at my first startup however, that I became aware of the coding world (e.g. HTML/CSS, SQL).

I was intrigued, but something held me back from diving in to learn. It was this unreasonable thought that it was too late for me to learn how to code and become an engineer. At this point (around 2015), I didn't know about the field of data analytics / science. I continued using excel, some SQL, and dabbled on codeacademy once awhile to learn HTML/CSS. Still unsure of my career path, I made a move to another startup. It was here I learned of data analytics as a career path. My day to day was not focused on analytics, but I interacted with people who have been in the field and were happy to share their knowledge.

I really enjoyed learning, but there still was a mental block preventing me from proactively pursing this path. For one thing, it was daunting. How could I possibly compete with people who learned this in college, and have years of experience up their sleeves? Thankfully, I had the opportunity to take a break from work for a few months. During this time, the same amazing friend who helped me build this website introduced me to [Udacity's Data Analytics Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?v=a4). While traveling in Europe, I spent maybe 50% of my waking hours working on data projects using tools like R, SQL, d3.js, and HTML/CSS. It was not easy, especially while traveling, but I had set a strict deadline to complete the program in 4 months. It was also a constant internal battle where I wrestled with doubtful thoughts of whether or not this is the right path for me and if it was, can I actually do well in it.

When I completed the program, it was probably one of the most proudest moments of my life. I am so grateful for the support that my family, Udacity mentor, and incredibly patient friend showed me during this rather tumultuous period.

It will not easy to make the transition, but I can confidently say that with so many free and affordable resources online that with patience and persistence, you can definitely do it. As cliche as it sounds, the most important thing is to believe in your ability cause I'd say doubt was the biggest obstacle in my journey.

### Next up!

In my next post, I'll share my favourite resources, and how I am continuing to learn in and outside of my job. Now...it's time to hop on my bike, and find a lunch spot where I can push this post live. :)
