Creating my first website where I'll be sharing data-related learnings and mini-projects.


``` python
def herewego (data):
  return "fun times with" + data
```

### Initial Plan

1. [Complete Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?v=a4).
2. Continue to build projects on GitHub
3. Share any cool findings on here!
4. Iterate.
